# airdataproject
The Air Data Program is originally an initiative from the University of Stuttgart and the OK Lab Stuttgart which is part of the program Code for Germany of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany and was founded in 2015. EDSP ECO has adopted the program, enrolled their concept in several cities in the Netherlands and we incorporated it in our Environmental Data Monitor Platform.    The aim of the program is to promote development in the areas of transparency, Open Data and Citizen Science. Regional groups consisting of designers, developers, journalists and others meet regularly in Labs. They develop apps that inform, positively shape and support society and make the work of administrations and authorities more transparent. The city of the future belongs to its citizens. The digital tools, the Maker Movement and Citizen Science are leading to more and more people being given the opportunity to design the city themselves.
